Hey,
    Everyone I'm Rohit straight to the point
    📝 Project Description

SecureBank is a console-based ATM simulation system built using Python.
This project focuses on secure authentication, file handling, and basic banking operations using JSON storage.

The system allows users to:

🔐 Set and verify a hashed PIN using SHA-256

💰 Check account balance

💸 Withdraw money with validation

💵 Deposit money

🚫 Lock account after multiple failed attempts

💾 Store user data securely in JSON files

🔒 Security Features

PIN is never stored in plain text

Uses Python hashlib module (SHA-256 hashing) it makes our simple pin into a complex pin ,so hacker cannot crack our pin

Account locks after 3 wrong attempts

negative withdrawals system means -500 want accept

🧠 Concepts Used
Functions

Loops (while True)

Conditional statements

JSON file handling (json.load, json.dump)

Hashing and encoding

Data validation

Modular file structure
